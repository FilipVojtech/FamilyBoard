Online Family Board  
Family Board is an multi-platform app primarily for phones.  
App is being synced with a server so your data is accesible virtually anywhere. 

## Why this?
This is my semi-annual work. It's a school project.

   Create a JavaScript app with minimum of 800 lines  

My goal was to learn a new JS framework. In the end I choose React Native.

2. Install project dependencies
3. Run on emulator/device
